# python-web-scrapping

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. Python is a popular programming language for web scraping due to its ease of use and powerful libraries such as Beautiful Soup and Scrapy.

In this project, we will be using web scraping to extract car data from [truecar.com](https://www.truecar.com/used-cars-for-sale/listings/price-above-1/). We will then use machine learning algorithms to predict the price of a car based on its features such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition.

1. The first step in this project is to identify the websites that contain the car data we need. We use Python's requests library to send HTTP requests to    these websites and retrieve their HTML content. Once we have the HTML content, we use Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML and extract the relevant data.

2. Next, we will clean and preprocess the data to ensure that it is ready for machine learning. This involves removing missing values, converting              categorical variables to numerical ones, and scaling the data to ensure that all features are on the same scale.

3. We will then split the data into training and testing sets and use machine learning **linear regression** algorithms to predict the price of a car.

4. Finally, we will evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared. We can use these      metrics to fine-tune our model and improve its accuracy.

In conclusion, web scraping and machine learning are powerful tools that can be used to predict the price of a car based on its features. By using Python and its libraries, we can automate the process of data extraction and analysis, making it easier and faster to make informed decisions about buying or selling a car.
